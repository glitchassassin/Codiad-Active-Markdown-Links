# Active Markdown Links #

**Active Markdown Links** (AML for short) is a plugin for [Codiad](http://codiad.com/), an open-source web-based IDE.

AML extends Codiad's Markdown editing functionality. When a Markdown file (like this one) has a link (like the one above), you can double-click on the link to open it in a new tab. It's convenient if you're reading someone else's Markdown for a project you imported - or just checking the links in your own.
